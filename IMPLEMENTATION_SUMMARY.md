# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified REST Endpoints from GET to POST with Basic Auth

The existing purchase order synchronization endpoints have been modified to use POST instead of GET methods with Basic Authentication:

- Changed `/sync/purchase-orders` from GET to POST
- Changed `/sync/purchase-orders/date-range` from GET to POST, now using request body for parameters
- Added basic authentication to both endpoints using the existing `basicAuth` middleware
- Added a new generic endpoint `/sync/kiotviet-data` that supports syncing different data types

### 2. Added Discord Bot Slash Command Integration

A new slash command has been added to the Discord bot for KiotViet data synchronization:

- Created `/clone-kv-data` command with a required `type` option
- The `type` option supports five choices:
  - `products` - Sync all products
  - `customers` - Sync all customers
  - `invoices` - Sync today's invoices only
  - `purchase-orders` - Sync purchase orders (last 3 months)
  - `all` - Sync all data types in sequence
- Added detailed progress feedback in Discord messages
- Added error handling with user-friendly messages
- Added a summary report for the 'all' option showing success/failure status for each data type

## Files Modified

1. `src/routes/syncRoutes.js`:
   - Updated route handlers to use POST methods
   - Added basic authentication middleware
   - Added new route for generic KiotViet data sync

2. `src/controllers/syncController.js`:
   - Updated parameter handling to use request body instead of query params
   - Added a new controller method for generic KiotViet data sync

3. `src/services/discordService.js`:
   - Added new slash command definition
   - Implemented command handler for KiotViet data cloning
   - Added progress reporting and error handling

4. `docs/PURCHASE_ORDER_SYNC.md`:
   - Updated documentation to reflect API changes
   - Added section on Discord bot integration
   - Updated example usage and troubleshooting sections

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Test all modified endpoints with proper authentication
   - Verify that POST requests work correctly with the JSON body
   - Test without authentication to confirm it's required

2. **Discord Integration**:
   - Test each data type option individually
   - Test the 'all' option to ensure sequential syncing works
   - Verify progress updates appear correctly in Discord
   - Test error handling by temporarily breaking a connection
