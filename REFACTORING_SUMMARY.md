# Gao Lam Thuy Internal Service - Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the refactoring changes made to the Gao Lam Thuy Internal Service codebase. The refactoring focused on improving code organization, reducing duplication, standardizing patterns, and enhancing maintainability.

## Major Changes

### 1. Centralized Database Access

- Created a centralized database client in `src/utils/database.js`

  - `executeQuery`: Common wrapper for database queries with error handling
  - `getRecordByField`: Fetch a record by a specific field
  - `insertRecord`: Insert a new record
  - `updateRecord`: Update an existing record
- Benefits: Reduced code duplication, centralized error handling, simplified database access

### 2. Standardized API Responses

- Created `src/utils/responseHandler.js` for consistent API responses
- Standardized functions:
  - `successResponse`: Standard success response
  - `errorResponse`: Standard error response
  - `validationError`: Validation error response
  - `notFoundError`: Not found error response
  - `htmlResponse`: HTML response for print routes
- Benefits: Consistent API responses, centralized error handling, reduced code duplication

### 3. Improved Date Utilities

- Created `src/utils/dateUtils.js` for date-related operations
- Added helper functions:
  - `getTodayComponents`: Get year, month, day for today
  - `formatYMD`: Format date as YYYY-MM-DD
  - `isValidYear`, `isValidMonth`, `isValidDay`: Date validation functions
- Benefits: Centralized date handling, consistent date formatting and validation

### 4. Enhanced Formatting Utilities

- Created `src/utils/formatters.js` for formatting operations
- Added helper functions:
  - `formatCurrency`: Format currency in Vietnamese format
  - `formatDate`: Format date in Vietnamese format
  - `formatDateTime`: Format date and time in Vietnamese format
- Benefits: Consistent formatting across the application

### 5. Service Layer for Business Logic

- Created `src/services/printService.js` to centralize print-related business logic
- Implemented functions:
  - `loadTemplate`: Load a template file
  - `processTemplate`: Process template variables
  - `generateInvoicePrint`: Generate invoice print HTML
  - `generateProductLabelPrint`: Generate product label print HTML
  - `createPrintJob`, `getPendingPrintJobs`, `updatePrintJobStatus`: Print job management
- Benefits: Separated business logic from route handlers, improved testability, reduced duplication

### 6. Refactored Route Handlers

- Updated route handlers to use the new utilities and services
- Implemented consistent patterns for route handling
- Benefits: Reduced code duplication, simplified route handlers, improved maintainability

### 7. Updated Error Handling

- Standardized error handling across the application
- Implemented consistent error logging
- Benefits: Better error reporting, improved debugging

## Files Changed

### New Files Created
- `src/utils/database.js`: Centralized database access
- `src/utils/responseHandler.js`: Standardized API responses
- `src/utils/dateUtils.js`: Date utilities
- `src/utils/formatters.js`: Formatting utilities
- `src/services/printService.js`: Print service

### Updated Files
- `src/app.js`: Updated to use standardized error handling
- `src/controllers/kiotvietController.js`: Updated to use utilities and standardized responses
- `src/routes/kiotvietRoutes.js`: Updated to use date utilities and response handlers
- `src/routes/posRoutes.js`: Updated to use standardized responses
- `src/routes/printRoutes.js`: Refactored to use new service layer
- `src/routes/printJobRoutes.js`: Refactored to use new service layer
- `src/server.js`: Updated to use date utilities

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated repeated code patterns by centralizing common functionality
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain with standardized patterns
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and reporting
4. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between route handlers, business logic, and data access
5. **More Consistent API Responses**: Standardized response formats for all API endpoints

## Next Steps

While this refactoring has significantly improved the codebase, there are additional improvements that could be made:

1. Implement unit tests for utility functions and services
2. Add input validation using a validation library
3. Enhance logging with structured logging
4. Consider implementing a dependency injection pattern for better testability
5. Evaluate performance optimizations for database queries 

## 1. Merge Sync Routes into KiotViet Routes

- Added sync routes to `kiotvietRoutes.js`
- Moved controller functions from `syncController.js` to `kiotvietController.js`
- Updated route references to use the merged controller
- Removed the sync routes from `app.js`

## 2. Restructure Print Templates

- Created a new directory structure at `src/views/templates/`
- Moved the invoice template from `docs/printInvoice.html` to `src/views/templates/invoice.html`
- Moved the label template from `docs/printLabel.html` to `src/views/templates/label.html`
- Updated `printService.js` to reference the new template locations

## 3. Merge Print Job Routes

- Merged routes from `printJobRoutes.js` into `printRoutes.js`
- Ensured all functionality was preserved during the merge
- Updated to use more consistent error handling and response formats
- Deleted the original `printJobRoutes.js` file

These refactoring changes have improved the codebase by:

1. Consolidating related functionality into logical groups
2. Following a more organized directory structure for templates
3. Reducing duplication and potential maintenance issues
4. Improving consistency in API responses and error handling

The application should continue to function with the same behavior but with a cleaner, more maintainable structure.
